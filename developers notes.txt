Version 3 of the CTC system software.

This version will be written using the .NET CMRI routines and the Test routines.

It will follow the general outline of Chapter 25 in the applications handbook, vol 2.

The panel will need to be altered to have code buttons... and room made on the inputs for said buttons. 

Check capacity of the system as it stands. Re-check all of the inputs and outputs and make sure they are labeled correctly.
